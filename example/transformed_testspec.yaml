                        an EMV fallback transaction because the attempted chip read was unsuccessful.

                        Reason the EMV transaction was sent online to the issuer.

                        Some POS terminals are configured to authorize EMV transactions offline without forwarding the transaction to the issuer. Other POS terminals send all transactions online to the issuer for authorization.

                        For a POS terminal that normally authorizes EMV transactions offline, some acquirers require a reason when an EMV transaction is sent online to the issuer.

                        Possible values:
                        - `01` :  The POS terminal could not process the application data file on the chip card.
                        - `02` : The POS terminal could not process the common data file on the chip card.
                        - `03` : (default): The chip application on the card forced the the transaction to be sent online.
                        - `04` : Issuer rules forced the transaction to be sent online. For example, the card is expired.
                        - `05` : The POS terminal forced the transaction to be sent online. For example, the results of tests the terminal performed during the EMV process indicated that the transaction must be sent online.
                        - `06` : The chip card detected suspicious activity. For example, there was an unsuccessful signature check or the card returned an inappropriate cryptogram.
                        - `07` : The transaction amount exceeds the limit for local transaction processing at the terminal.
                        - `08` : The POS terminal randomly selected the transaction for online processing or rules in the client software that is installed on the POS terminal forced the transaction to be sent online. For example, the card was used a specified number of times within a certain time limit or the client software requires that a certain percentage of EMV transactions be sent online.
